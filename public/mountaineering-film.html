    <h2><li>The Dawn Wall (2017)</li></h2>

        <p>I cried buckets while watching this in absolute awe. It was probably my third mountaineering film, following Valley Uprising and Free Solo.</p>
        <p><b>Where to watch:</b> Documentary Mania or YouTube</p>
    <h2> <li>The Alpinist (2021)</li></h2>

        <p>I decided to take on my PT instructor's recommendation and watch my very first ice-climbing documentary, The Alpinist,
            when I ran out of climbing films to watch -- and what a journey it had taken me since. It was almost cruel as it is deeply inspiring to watch the climber scale on the beautiful, stately icy mountain unflinchingly and mercilessly cold.</p>
    <h2><li>Touching The Void (2003)</li></h2>

        <p>When I got lost on a hazy sunny day at Moel Siabod (872m) in Snowdnia National Park in Spring 2023, images of this film flashed crossed my mind, reminding me that I could have been in more dire situations. </p>
        <p><b>Where to watch: Netflix
            </b></p>
    <h2><li>Sherpa (2015)</li></h2>

        <p>I didn't plan it, but I'm glad I had watched this before watching 14 Peaks. Finally, I've learnt about the rich history of Sherpas climbing and summitting Everest, and helping numerous climbers to do so till present. This film was also set... </p>
    <h2><li>14 Peaks (2021) </li></h2>
