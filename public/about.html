<p>Hello! I'm Yi Yun, a digital marketing apprentice at Google UK, formerly trained as an orchestra conductor at University of Oxford (BA) and the Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama (MMus).</p>

<p>I'm passionate about bringing a project or product to life with a team to create a memorable experience for our users. Prior to joining Google, I was a marketer and artistic director at a Malaysian classical music social enterprise in Malaysia, and a project co-ordinator and music programmer for the 2022 LATES: Animals exhibition event at National Museum Cardiff.</p>

<p>I'm excited to see how I could bring my interests and expertise together in the near future!</p>

<p>As a conductor, I am keen to perform works by contemporary composers and historically-underrepresented groups in my self-directed concerts. I've performed with the Welsh National Opera orchestra, the Oxfordshire County Youth Orchestra, and Kuala Lumpur Performing Arts Centre Orchestra, and worked with the Oxford Philharmonia and Malaysia Philharmonic Orchestra in masterclasses.</p>

<p>As a project leader, I've led education and outreach programmes with refugees, as well as workshops with prisoners, children and young adults with special needs.</p>

<h3>My Next Challenge (other than completing this web development course)</h6>
<p>Confidently navigate ~800m mountains with a compass and a map (and not get lost as I did on my solo descent down Moel Siabod in Snowdonia National Park)</p>
